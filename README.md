# Project Description

Help a band of magical elf musicians defend the holy crystal from an onslaught of blood-thisrty demons! Strum, beat, and blow your instruments in time with the song to activate protective sigils.

# Intended usage:

Select a song from the menu. Use WASD or the arrow keys to activate the corresponding sigils. Wait for the demon to be in the middle of the sigil to get the highest possible score.
